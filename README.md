## For Users

Currently, this is an alpha-stage demo of what QtPollyNom shall become. A pre-release of the current status has been made available. For comparison and an impression of the eventual feature set, see [PollyNom](https://github.com/tristhaus/pollynom). See Release tab for up-to-date information on what is already supported. You may contact me at `qtpollynom` at `gmail.com` for comments on the program.

## For Developers

I am currently not looking for contributors since this is primarily a showcase. This may change at a later stage.
